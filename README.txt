Hi, Here's my thoughts and suggestions about the project

Thoughts about the code:
   As it looks like, the developer used the Repository method in this project,
   The repository design pattern allows you to use objects without having to know how these objects are persisted. Essentially it is an abstraction of the data layer.
   This means that your business logic doesnâ€™t need to know how data is retrieved or what the source of the data is.
   Using repository method is good for huge projects and modules, but not for small projects, the samll projects processing we
   can write in traits or controller, and it's okay to write it over there. And we should write normal todos method in code, and the core methods or modules
   which process the data should be written in repository.

What makes it amazing code:
    I observe the BookingRepository methods by methods, the good practice is we as i explain in top up in the description we  should use the small todo in controller
    and should only write the code and processing methods in repository, and they should be written as professionally,
    like small methods for checking or validating data, and processing methods should be written as only to process data, and they need to be well defined.
    as per small validating methods we can call them in  class any time anywhere in the class to filtering the data, Also we can use those filter methods in controller are anywhere else. if they were written
    to filter data then we can reuse them, so no need to re-write those method again again to filter the data in same repository or in any other.

what makes it terrible code:
    Some methods are not written professionally, like you can see that store method in repository. first it filter and validate data then it, store's the data and sent response back.
    if we separate that method into two methods validation and Storing, then our validation method can be resued in case of store any where else.
    and also small methods are easy to read and re-write.

How would you have done it:
    I would write to like do the todo task in controller, and the maain bussiness logics in the repository, for data validation and filtration will use th traits.
    Reason is, when the filtration and validation are written in traits, then they are easy to call anywhere in the projects, in any controller in any repository. So I will save time and effort here,
   Only in special cases will write will bind them in their repository. Using too much repository methods in project is useless, that means you are creating an extra layer without any user of it,
   It should be only used for main business logics.  and it's also junior team to understand that, most important part of the project are written in repository, So they need to be careful if they are going to work
   over there. and in the current repository, everything is written here.


As per refactoring the code There's nothing to much to refactor, It's code looks okay, And developer can only refactor it if he  has knowledge about the product/project or atleast full of its attached file in a class



And I attached the two cases with sample data in the project


So as per task X + Refactor Code + Test Cases are attached in GitHub Repo.
